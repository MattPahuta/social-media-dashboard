## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Toggle color theme to their preference

### Requirments

- light/dark mode toggle
- local storage for mode preference memory
- CSS variables
- prefers-color-scheme media query
Accessibility
- accessible content (accessibility standards)
- proper heading levels
- screenreader only text

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

### Useful resources

- [freeCodeCamp with Jessica Chan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krfUjg0S2uI) - Jessica produced this excellent tutorial for FreeCodeCamp where she works through this project design. I only ended up skimming this tutorial, but it's clearly very comprehensive and the quality is typically excellent coming from CoderCoder so a great resource for learners (especially if you use Sass like she is, which I was not).
- [Example resource 2](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
